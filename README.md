# attendance-data
This repository lists dumps for the Attendance Scanner records. Anonymized dumps of the 
data is available in the top level directory, while encrypted originals are stored in `/private/`.

The anonymized data is limited to the last 4 digits of a students ID number. This allows for
entinties to be identified, but limits malicious actions that could be caused by anyone having
a list of complete student ID numbers.
